# Twitch Chat Bot using Node.js
- This bot is going to start off with a few basic features, including:
	- Recurring messages & reminders for chatters
	- Moderation for specific keywords
	- Interactive commands
	
# Implementation
- This bot was creating by following the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/) documentation. 
- Twitch recommends using the [websocket package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket) with Node.js, however there are many different ways to implement and access their API.

# Usage
- If you want to download and use this, just follow these steps:
	- You have to create a twitch account for yourself if you don't have one already, and then also create one for the bot.
	- You need to [register the app](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/). You may use this guide from the TwitchAPI as a frame of reference.
	- There are a few lines in the app.js file that will need to be changed as some of the information is generated specific to your twitch account.
